Migrations are scripts or instructions that specify how the database schema should change. 
Each migration corresponds to a specific, discrete change to the schema, such as creating a new table, adding or modifying columns, 
creating indexes, or defining relationships between tables. Migrations are typically versioned to ensure they are applied in a specific order.
