Explain Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling
Scaling Horizontal and Vertical mysql 
Difference between Where and Having Clause in SQL : 


primary and unique key and forign key?

primary key:-
Cannot contain NULL values.
Every table should have one primary key.
A primary key automatically creates a clustered index in most databases
its auto increament

unique key:-
Ensures that all values in the column are unique, but null values are allowed.
Can contain one or more NULL values.
a column or set of columns must be unique, but it's not required to identify a record.


Key Differences:
Feature	Primary Key	Unique Constraint
Uniqueness	Must be unique
Nullability	Cannot contain NULL values	Can contain NULL values
Number per Table Only one primary key per table	Multiple unique constraints per table
Purpose	Used to uniquely identify each record	Used to ensure unique values in a column
Index Type	Usually creates a clustered index	Usually creates a non-clustered index


Key Differences:
Feature	DROP	DELETE	TRUNCATE
Removes	Entire table (or object)	Specific rows or all rows	All rows from the table
Table structure	Table is removed entirely	Table remains intact	Table remains intact
Rollback	Generally, cannot be rolled back	Can be rolled back (in a transaction)	Depends on DBMS
Logging	Not logged	Logs each row deletion	Doesn't log individual rows
Speed	Slow for large tables (depends)	Slower for large datasets	Faster for large datasets
Condition	Cannot specify a condition	Can specify a WHERE condition	No condition; removes all rows
Foreign Key Check	Fails if there are dependent FK	Complies with FK checks	Ignores FK constraints in some DBMS

Summary:
DROP: Permanently removes a table or object, including structure and data.
DELETE: Removes specific rows or all rows but keeps the table structure.
TRUNCATE: Quickly removes all rows but keeps the table structure; faster than DELETE for large datasets.


groupby
sales Table:
id	product_name	quantity	price	sale_date
1	Apple	10	1.00	2024-09-01
2	Banana	5	0.50	2024-09-01
3	Apple	3	1.00	2024-09-02
4	Orange	8	0.80	2024-09-02
5	Banana	6	0.50	2024-09-03

query:-
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name;

Result:-
product_name	total_quantity
Apple	13s
Banana	11
Orange	8



having query:-
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name HAVING total_quantity > 10;

Result:
product_name	total_quantity
Apple	13
Banana	11



index use:-
create index studdob On students (dob); add multiple columns  //create index
show index from students;         //show index
drop index studdob On students;



table multiple case
UPDATE db.Table1 SET col2 = (CASE col2 WHEN 1 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END);


//second highest salary
SELECT MAX(amount) from salary_stuctures ss1
WHERE amount < (SELECT MAX(amount) from salary_stuctures ss2 ); 



table  multiple case
UPDATE db.Table1 SET col2 = (CASE col2 WHEN 1 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END);


Migrations are scripts or instructions that specify how the database schema should change. 
Each migration corresponds to a specific, discrete change to the schema, such as creating a new table, adding or modifying columns, 
creating indexes, or defining relationships between tables. Migrations are typically versioned to ensure they are applied in a specific order.

join example:-
right
left
full join
inner join
self
CARTESIAN join
CROSS JOIN

IN Operator
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

The SQL BETWEEN Operator
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

The SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions


SQL HAVING Examples
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;

what is Scalable mysql Horizontal and Vertical?


doubt?
11 orm what is meaning pros const with example
object oriented db
bson format
json bson


SELECT employees.id, employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;


transection:-
A transaction in MySQL is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are treated as a single,
indivisible unit of work. Transactions are used to maintain data integrity and consistency in a database
a transaction is a sequence of SQL statements that are executed as a single unit. Transactions ensure that 
either all operations are completed successfully, or none of them are applied, which is useful in maintaining the integrity of the database.
BEGIN / START TRANSACTION: Begins a transaction.
COMMIT: Saves the changes made during the transaction.
ROLLBACK: Reverts the changes made during the transaction.
