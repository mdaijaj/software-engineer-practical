virtual properties allow you to define computed or derived properties on your Mongoose models. 
These virtual properties do not exist in the MongoDB document stored in the database; 
instead, they are calculated on the fly when you access them.

example:-

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
});
// Define a virtual property called 'fullName'
userSchema.virtual('fullName').get(function () {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);


second highest salary
db.employees.aggregate([
  {
    $sort: { salary: -1 }
  },
  {
    $skip: 1
  },
  {
    $limit: 1
  }
]);


Migrations are scripts or instructions that specify how the database schema should change. 
Each migration corresponds to a specific, discrete change to the schema, such as creating a new table, adding or modifying columns, creating indexes, or defining relationships between tables. Migrations are typically versioned to ensure they are applied in a specific order.
