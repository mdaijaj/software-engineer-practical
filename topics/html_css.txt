1. What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?
Answer:
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, meaning it is designed for laying out items in a single row or column (either horizontally or vertically). It works great for controlling the alignment, spacing, and ordering of items along a single axis.

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, meaning it can control the placement of items in both rows and columns simultaneously. Grid is more suited for building complex layouts involving multiple rows and columns.


Centering with Flexbox:
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Horizontal centering */
  align-items: center;     /* Vertical centering */
  height: 100vh;           /* Full height of the viewport */
}

.item {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}


Centering with CSS Grid:
.container {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center; /* Both horizontal and vertical centering */
  height: 100vh;
}

.item {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
