1. What is PostgreSQL?
Answer:
PostgreSQL is an open-source, advanced relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. It is known for its reliability, scalability, and extensibility.

2. How is PostgreSQL different from MySQL?
Answer:
Feature	PostgreSQL	MySQL
ACID Compliance	Fully ACID-compliant	ACID-compliant (except MyISAM engine)
Joins & Subqueries	More advanced support	Limited support
Indexing	Supports GIN, BRIN, etc.	Supports only standard B-tree indexes
JSON Support	Advanced JSONB storage	JSON storage but less optimized

3. What are the key features of PostgreSQL?
Answer:
ACID compliance
Support for JSONB (binary JSON)
Full-text search capabilities
Advanced indexing (GIN, BRIN, etc.)
Table partitioning
Replication & high availability

4. How do you create a database in PostgreSQL?
Example:

sql query:-
CREATE DATABASE mydb;
To switch to the database:

sql query:-
\c mydb

5. How do you list all databases in PostgreSQL?
Command:

sql query:-
\l
or

sql query:-
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;

6. What is the difference between CHAR, VARCHAR, and TEXT?
Data Type	Description
CHAR(n)	Fixed-length string (padded with spaces)
VARCHAR(n)	Variable-length string with a maximum limit n
TEXT	Unlimited-length string
Example:

sql query:-
CREATE TABLE test_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    description TEXT
);

7. How do you create a table in PostgreSQL?
Example:

sql query:-
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2),
    joining_date DATE
);

8. What are indexes in PostgreSQL, and what types of indexes does it support?
Answer:
Indexes improve query performance by allowing faster lookups. PostgreSQL supports:

B-Tree (default)
GIN (for full-text search)
BRIN (for large tables)
Hash Index
Example:

sql query:-
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees (name);

9. How do you perform a backup and restore in PostgreSQL?
Backup Command:

sh query:-
pg_dump -U username -d mydb -F c -f backup_file.dump
Restore Command:

sh query:-
pg_restore -U username -d mydb -F c backup_file.dump

10. What are the different types of joins in PostgreSQL?
Answer:

INNER JOIN: Returns matching rows from both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
FULL JOIN: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
Example:

sql query:-
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
Intermediate PostgreSQL Questions

11. What is the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN?
Example:

sql query:-
-- INNER JOIN (Only matching records)
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;

-- LEFT JOIN (All employees, even without department)
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;

-- RIGHT JOIN (All departments, even if no employees)
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;

12. How do you optimize a slow query in PostgreSQL?
Answer:

Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE
Add proper indexes
Avoid **SELECT ***
Use proper data types
Use partitioning for large tables
Example:

sql query:-
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

13. What is the EXPLAIN ANALYZE command?
Answer:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE helps analyze query execution plans and suggests optimizations.

Example:

sql query:-
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';

14. What are CTEs (Common Table Expressions)?
Example:

sql query:-
WITH high_salary AS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000
)
SELECT * FROM high_salary;
15. What are PostgreSQL schemas?
Example:

sql query:-
CREATE SCHEMA company;
CREATE TABLE company.employees (id SERIAL, name VARCHAR(100));

16. What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE?
Answer:

WHERE filters rows before aggregation.
HAVING filters after aggregation.
Example:

sql query:-
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 40000 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

17. How does PostgreSQL handle transactions?
Example:

sql query:-
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

18. What is ON CONFLICT in PostgreSQL?
Example:

sql query:-
INSERT INTO employees (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET name = EXCLUDED.name;

19. What is the difference between SERIAL and UUID for primary keys?
Answer:
SERIAL: Auto-incrementing integer
UUID: Globally unique identifier, useful for distributed systems
Example:

sql query:-
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

20. How does PostgreSQL implement full-text search?
Example: 

sql query:-
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE to_tsvector(content) @@ to_tsquery('PostgreSQL');


prisma setup:-
npx prisma 
npx prisma init
