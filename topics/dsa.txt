time complexity
1. Constant Time(O(1)): If the running time does not depend on the
input size (n) then it is known as constant running time. It can be
represented as 

2. Linear Time O(kn): If the time complexity is at most a constant factor
times the size of the input, then it is known as linear time complexity
and is presented as T(n) <=kn where k is a constant or T(n) =O(n).
